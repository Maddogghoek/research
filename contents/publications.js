      "Systematic over-crediting in California's forest carbon offsets program",
    date: '10-20-2021',
    color: 'green',
    summary:
      "California's forest offset program is worth over $2 billion. We analyzed detailed public records to show how statistical flaws in the program's design have led to over-crediting — at a scale of tens of millions of tCO₂ and hundreds of millions of dollars.",

    title: 'Climate risks to carbon sequestration in US forests',
    color: 'red',
    journal: 'biorxiv',
    summary:
      'Forests in the United States are already at risk from wildfire, drought, and insects, and climate change is making it worse. We combined satellite and ecological data with climate models to project future risks to forest carbon. Along with a preprint, we are releasing open data, open software, and an interactive web map.',
